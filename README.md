## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Revenue Hub Concentration** — Jaipur (34.4%), Kochi (15.7%), and Chandigarh (10.2%) drive ~60% of total revenue. Mysore and Coimbatore need demand stimulation strategies.

2. **Repeat Passengers Drive Business** — Repeat passengers generated **51% of revenue** and **58% of trips**. Strong case for loyalty programs and subscription-based growth models.

3. **Trip & Passenger Target Gaps** — Overall shortfall of **–3,097 trips** vs target. Jaipur missed new passenger targets by –8K. Lucknow had the largest trip deficit (–7,701). June saw a **–14.61% revenue decline**.

4. **Rating Gap** — Driver rating (7.83) exceeds passenger rating (7.66). Lucknow and Vadodara show below-average passenger satisfaction, indicating service improvement zones.

5. **Weekday Demand Dominates** — Lucknow (50K) and Jaipur (44K) show strong weekday patterns, indicating business travel. Surat and Kochi show notable weekend activity suggesting tourism influence.

6. **Pricing Efficiency** — Jaipur commands the highest fare per trip (₹483.92 / 30 km). Pricing models across low-fare cities like Surat and Vadodara should be reviewed for margin optimisation.

## ❓ Analysis Questions Addressed

### Primary (Data-Driven)
1. Top 3 and Bottom 3 cities by total trips over the full period
2. Average fare per trip vs average trip distance by city — pricing efficiency
3. Average passenger and driver ratings by city, segmented by new vs repeat passengers
4. Peak demand month and low demand month per city
5. Weekday vs weekend trip demand comparison across all 10 cities
6. Repeat passenger frequency and city contribution to higher trip counts
7. Monthly target achievement for trips, new passengers, and avg ratings
8. Highest and lowest RPR% cities (top 2 / bottom 2) and months

### Secondary (Research & Recommendations)
1. **Repeat Rate Drivers** — What factors (service quality, pricing, demographics) influence RPR% differences across cities?
2. **Tourism vs Business Demand** — How do festivals, events, and tourism seasons affect demand patterns?
3. **EV & Mobility Trends** — Should Goodcabs integrate electric vehicles or eco-friendly initiatives for tier-2 competitiveness?
4. **Local Partnerships** — Partnership opportunities with hotels, malls, and event venues to boost demand and loyalty
